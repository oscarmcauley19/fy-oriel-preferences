# UKFP Random Allocation Simulator
## Problem Definition
In the UK, all of our Doctors go through the [UK Foundation Programme](https://foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/programmes/2-year-foundation-programme/ukfp/), which is generally the first training program applicants undergo after graduating from their Medicine degree.

The UKFP is split amongst 19 deaneries, which represent all parts of the UK. Here are some of the deaneries for example:
- London
- Northern Ireland
- Severn
- West Midlands

As of 2024, applicants to the UKFP are randomly allocated a deanery based on the individual's preferred ranking. Some deaneries may be oversubscribed, whilst others will be undersubscribed; the applicant is incentivised to vote strategically to increase their chances of a consistent, satisfactory allocation.
